Our projects are primarily research-focused, tackling major technical challenges in software engineering and cybersecurity by developing innovative artificial intelligence techniques. We are also keen to work closely with governments, industries, and communities to solve their problems through technological innovation. Most of our projects were funded or in collaboration with industry partners such as Defence Science and Technology Group, AFL, Flinders Medical Centre, Tencent, Alibaba, Huawei, Zhongxing, and Meituan.
